we’ll train a reinforcement learning agent to pick up passengers and drive them to their destination in the classic OpenAI Gym environment using the Taxi-v3 dataset.

By training our agent to make optimal decisions such as choosing the best route and avoiding traffic, we’ll help you develop the technology for the next generation of autonomous taxis.
