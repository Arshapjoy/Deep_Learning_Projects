we will use machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies in time-series data using the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark dataset. We will explore the data, preprocess it, and apply techniques such as Autoencoder, LSTM, and Prophet to build our model. With our model, we can detect anomalies in real-time, helping companies prevent system failures, security breaches, and other critical events.
